# DialPulse CRM

A telecalling- and WhatsApp-first sales CRM prototype built to unify lead management and active outreach in one interface.

> **Note:** This is a prototype and work-in-progress generated via Google AI Studio. It is not currently production-ready.

## Key Features

*   **Lead Management & Pipeline:** Interactive Kanban board for tracking leads across custom stages.
*   **Integrated Calling Console:** Make calls directly from the CRM (audio and transcripts are currently simulated if an AI key is not provided).
*   **WhatsApp Messaging:** Send predefined templates and track delivery statuses seamlessly.
*   **Dashboard & Reporting:** Live metrics, conversion rates, and call stats visualization.
*   **Leaderboard:** Gamified ranking of sales reps based on conversions and call volume.
*   **Trust & Compliance Center:** Automated, server-enforced guardrails for quiet hours and daily contact frequency caps.
*   **Support Tickets:** Basic integrated issue tracking functionality.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 19.0.1, Vite 6.2.3, ESBuild
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.1.14
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express 4.21.2
*   **Data Layer:** Local file-backed JSON (`data/db.json`)

For an in-depth architectural deep-dive, see the [BRAIN.md](BRAIN.md) document.

## Engineering Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

DialPulse Client CRM adheres to a formal, auditable 12-phase SDLC framework:

*   **[Master SDLC Playbook](BRAIN/SDLC-PLAYBOOK.md)** — Operational lifecycle standard (Requirements → Design → Testing → Security → Release → Maintenance).
*   **[SDLC Baseline Assessment](docs/SDLC-BASELINE.md)** — Current engineering baseline, architecture profile, and maturity rating.
*   **[Requirement Traceability Matrix](docs/REQUIREMENT-TRACEABILITY.md)** — Real requirement IDs (`CRM-REQ-*`, `CRM-SEC-*`, etc.) and technical truth mappings.
*   **[Multi-Tier Test Strategy](docs/TEST-STRATEGY.md)** — Unit, integration, and 38-check adversarial security harness.
*   **[Production Release Checklist](docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md)** — Mandatory pre-flight verification gate for deployments.
*   **[GitHub & PR Workflow](docs/GITHUB-WORKFLOW.md)** — Branch naming, conventional commits, and pull request policies.

## Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** v18+ (required for native `fetch` support and Vite compatibility)
*   **Package Manager:** Bun is the expected package manager (a `bun.lock` file is included in this repository), though npm/yarn can also be used.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtharvaNavlekar/CRM.git
   cd CRM
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Fill in the variables in your new `.env` file. *(Note: If hosting via AI Studio, these are automatically injected from your Secrets panel. For local runs, they must be set manually.)*
   *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for Gemini AI API calls (transcript generation).
   *   `APP_URL`: The URL where this applet is hosted (used for self-referential links).
   *   `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for signing session JWT tokens.
   *   `JWT_EXPIRY`: Token lifespan (e.g., `24h`).

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
   This command starts the full stack (backend API and Vite frontend server concurrently) via `tsx`.

## Available Scripts

The following scripts are defined in `package.json`:

| Script | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dev` | Runs the backend and frontend development server concurrently using `tsx`. |
| `build` | Builds the frontend with Vite and bundles the backend via ESBuild. |
| `start` | Starts the production server using the built `dist/server.cjs` file. |
| `preview` | Previews the built Vite frontend production bundle locally. |
| `clean` | Removes the `dist` directory and any compiled server files. |
| `lint` | Runs TypeScript type checking without emitting files. |
| `test` | Runs the primary authentication and compliance tests. |
| `test:security` | Runs the comprehensive security test suite. |

## Project Structure

*   `src/components/` - React frontend components (grouped by feature/domain)
*   `src/context/` - Global React state management (e.g., ThemeContext)
*   `src/lib/` - Shared frontend utilities
*   `server/` - Node.js Express backend logic (`auth.ts`, `db.ts`, `compliance.ts`)
*   `security-tests/` - Automated security and compliance verification scripts
*   `tests/` - Application logic unit and integration tests
*   `data/` - Contains the `db.json` file used for application state persistence (Note: this directory is git-ignored as it contains runtime data).

## Seed Data and Production Safety

*   **Local State Only**: Runtime database files (`data/db.json`), backups, exports, and generated logs are local to your environment and must **never** be committed to Git.
*   **Production Safety**: When `NODE_ENV=production`, the application boots in a secured, fail-closed state. No default users, demo leads, or test configurations are inserted into the database.
*   **Bootstrap Admin**: To provision the first platform administrator in a production environment, run `npm run bootstrap-admin <email> <password> [name]`. Predictable passwords like `password123` are strictly forbidden.
*   **Development Seeding**: Running the app locally (`npm run dev`) automatically injects development dummy data into `data/db.json` for rapid testing and UI mockups.

## Current Status & Limitations

This repository is a prototype generated via Google AI Studio. While the foundational features work, several limitations exist:
*   Data persistence is handled via a naive, synchronous local JSON file, meaning it lacks genuine concurrency controls.
*   Authentication, authorization, and compliance-related guardrails may require further hardening for a production environment. 

Please refer to [BRAIN.md](BRAIN.md) for an honest, up-to-date assessment of the codebase's current state and implementation gaps.
